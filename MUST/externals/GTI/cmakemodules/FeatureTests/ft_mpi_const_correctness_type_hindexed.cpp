/**
 * This test evaluates whether we require const correctness that was introduced with MPI 3.
 * The basic const correctness test is "ft_mpi_const_correctness.c".
 *
 * This test looks at an unclear case that differs depending on MPI,
 * which is MPI_Type_hindexed:
 * - OpenMPI 1.8.2 (MPI-3) chooses to not use const in its definition
 * - Cray mpich 7.1.1 (MPI-?) chooses to use const in its definition
 *
 * So this specialized test case determines which handling we need for this specific function.
 * (The underlying thing is that MPI_Type_hindexed was deprecated, so
 *  apparently OpenMPI choose to not adapt it to const correctness,
 *  while the Cray MPICH apparently does so)
