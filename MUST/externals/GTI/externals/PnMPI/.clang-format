# This is the clang-format configuration for PnMPI.
#
# Clang-format should help to beautify the code, so that every developer can
# write code, while the beautifier will take care about the style guides. Please
# read the README and/or docs for more informations, how to use this
# configuration with clang-format.


# Basically we use LLVM style, but have some changes listed in this
# configuration.

MaxEmptyLinesToKeep: 3

# If lines must be continued in a second line, indent the second line with two
# spaces.
