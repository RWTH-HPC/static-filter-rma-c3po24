<!-- Node for the default communication mode.

-->
<!ELEMENT default (comm-strategy, comm-protocol)>

<!-- A connection between two levels.
     If the levels differ it is a inter communication between layers,
     for equal levels it is an intra communication.
     Either it specifies a comm strategy and a 
     comm protocol, or it uses the default 
     communication mechanism (only for inter communication).
     Intra communication is not allowed on the application level!
  - bottom-level: order of the level that
                  sends information about records.
  - top-level: order of the level that receives 
               information about records.
  - distribution: Either "uniform" or "by-block". Specifies how nodes in the lower
               level are distributed across the upper level. For uniform, each node
               in the upper level is mapped to an equal number of lower level ranks.
               If an exact distribution is not possible, remaining nodes are added to 
               the first nodes of the upper layer. E.g., distributiong nodes L0-L6 to three 
               nodes on the upper layer (U0-U2) results in L0,L1,L2 connected to U0; L3,L4 
               connected to U1; and L5, L6 connected to U2 with the uniform distribution.
               The "by-block" distribution uses a specified blocksize (blocksize attribute must 
               be set). In this case each complete block of the lower level is connected with 
               one node of the upper level. The last block may not be used completely.
               E.g., distributiong nodes L0-L6 to three 
               nodes on the upper layer (U0-U2) with a blocksize of 3 results in L0,L1,L2 
               connected to U0; L3,L4,L5 connected to U1; and L6 connected to U2 with 
               the by-block distribution. [optional, default uniform]
  - blocksize: Specifies distribution for distribution="by-block" [optional, must be set if
                     by-block is used].
